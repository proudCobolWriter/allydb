# Introduction

Welcome to AllyDB Docs!

## What is AllyDB?

AllyDB is a database that is built using Elixir. It is mostly a learning project, but I will try to make it as usable as possible.

## Should you use it?

Probably not.

It is not as stable and most likely not as fast as Redis or other similar databases.
It also has less features than Redis.

However, if you want to learn how to build a similar project, you can use this project as a reference.
