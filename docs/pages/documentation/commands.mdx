# Commands

AllyDB commands are similar to Redis. They are case-insensitive and end with a newline character.

### Example of a command

```sh
> COMMAND arg1 arg2
```

### Example of running a command in Node.js

```js
const net = require("net");

const client = net.createConnection(4000, () => {
  client.write("COMMAND arg1 arg2\n");
});
```
