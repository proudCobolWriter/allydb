# Persistence

The database is persisted to a file using ETS. The file is located at `allydb.tab` by default.

The database is persisted on a regular interval and not on every change. The interval is `3000ms` by default.

This means that if you make a change to the database, it might not be persisted immediately.

You can change the persistence interval using the `PERSISTENCE_INTERVAL` environment variable (in milliseconds) to make it persist more often, but this might mean a higher CPU and disk usage.
