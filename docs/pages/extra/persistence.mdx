# Persistence

The database is persisted to an append only log file. This means that the database can be restored to a previous state.

The database is also persisted on a regular interval, in case something happens to the log file.

The interval can be configured using the `PERSISTENCE_INTERVAL` environment variable. The default value is `3000ms`.
